# Bin Map – Walking Skeleton

This is a simple **walking skeleton** of our Bin Map project. Although development has been halted as we transitioned to another project, the current version includes functional features such as:

- Accessing your **current location**
- Displaying nearby **bin locations around Imperial College London**
- Integrating with the **Google Maps API** to provide navigation to the nearest bin

## 🌍 Why We Built This

Many people told us they often can't find a bin nearby and are forced to carry items like coffee cups or other rubbish for long distances. Our aim was to **improve urban cleanliness and convenience** by making bin locations easier to discover.

While this is currently just a web app, it is designed with mobile users in mind and can easily be extended into a mobile app in the future.
